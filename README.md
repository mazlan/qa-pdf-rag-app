# Sample PDF Question Answer Application! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Trying my hand on building a simple RAG application. This application is build using OpenAI, Langchain, Chainlit, and Chroma. The goal of this application is to provite a quick overview of the most basic archetype of RAG based LLM QA application. The prompts are engineered to specifically answer questions in the example PDF provided in the repo: [NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Second Quarter Fiscal 2024](<./sample_pdf/NVDA 2QFY24.pdf>)
